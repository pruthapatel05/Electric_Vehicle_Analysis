# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis with Tableau

## Project Overview 🌍

This project performs an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data to explore trends in EV adoption, the impact of CAFV (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) eligibility, and the distribution of BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) across different makes and models. The data is visualized using Tableau, allowing for easy interpretation of key metrics and insights.

### Key Insights 📊:
- **Average Electric Range:** 67.83 miles
- **Total Vehicles Analyzed:** 150,422
- **Total BEV Vehicles:** 116,750 (77.6% of total vehicles)
- **Total PHEV Vehicles:** 33,672 (22.4% of total vehicles)
- **Top 5 Vehicle Models:** 
  - Tesla Model Y
  - Tesla Model 3
  - Nissan Leaf
  - Chevy Bolt EV
  - Tesla Model S
- **Top 5 Manufacturers:**
  - Tesla
  - Nissan
  - Chevrolet
  - Ford
  - BMW

## Features and Visualizations 📈:
- **Total Vehicles by Model Year**: A line chart showing the increasing adoption of EVs from 2012 to 2024.
- **Total Vehicles by Make**: A bar chart highlighting the most popular manufacturers.
- **Total Vehicles by Model**: A breakdown of the most popular electric vehicle models.
- **CAF Eligibility**: Visualization of vehicles' eligibility for CAFV, showing a distribution of eligible vs. non-eligible vehicles.
- **State-wise Distribution**: A map showing the distribution of EVs across different U.S. states.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Excel/CSV Data**: Data sources include various datasets for electric vehicle sales and attributes.
- **Data Analysis**: Basic data aggregation and filtering performed to segment by vehicle make, model, type, and CAFV eligibility.


## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: The Tableau workbook allows users to filter data by model, make, state, and CAFV eligibility.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: The graphs and charts update in real-time based on user input and filter options, making it easy to explore different insights from the dataset.
